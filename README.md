## Personal Statement

I see myself as the Product Owner for Quality and the person that will collaborate with teams to ensure we build capabilities to uplift an organisationâ€™s quality. I am a strong believer in building community and enjoy working with internal and external teams to drive quality as a common goal while expanding individuals' capabilities. 

Metrics are an essential way of how I do work. I enjoy building the right scorecards for each team to ensure data-driven decisions take place, and the relevant capabilities are built. I am not shy and like to present the team success to stakeholders as well as taking responsibility for our mistakes. I am a firm believer of fail fast, fail often, learn from your mistakes and don't repeat them.
